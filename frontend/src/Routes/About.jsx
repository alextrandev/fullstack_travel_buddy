          growing our skills and contributing to meaningful projects. We believe
          in collaboration, continuous learning, and pushing the boundaries of
          what we can achieve.Our Foremap App is the first project of us as a junior web developer, designed to showcase our skills, which we gained during our first semesters in Helsinki Business College. This project aims to create an online presence that highlights our abilities in HTML, CSS,  JavaScript, React and Symphony, while also incorporating responsive design principles to ensure the site looks great on all devices.
          By completing this project, we have had to:gain hands-on experience in building a complete website from scratch, as well as we understand the fundamentals of web design and development.
          We tried to prectice how to create a responsive design that works on various devices with our app.
          Our skills in using in using HTML, CSS, React and Symfony have growned up signficaly.
          Also one really important practice for us using version control with Git and GitHub.
