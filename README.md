## For development team

**To setup local development environment**
1. Clone the project: ``` git clone https://github.com/alextrandev/fullstack_travel_buddy.git```
2. Change to frontend directory: ```cd fullstack_travel_buddy/frontend```
3. Install frontend dependencies: ```npm i```
4. Host the frontend in local server: ```npm run dev```
5. Open a new terminal, cd to backend folder.
6. Install backend dependencies: ```composer i```
7. Host the backend in local server: ```symfony serve```

Frontend should run on local port: ```http://localhost:5173```. _If not, check the console for the right port_
Backend should run on local port: ```https://127.0.0.1:8000``` _If not then check the console for the right port_

**Before working on a feature**
1. Remember to pull the changes from main branch ```git pull origin main```
2. Create a new branch with your name and the feature ```git checkout -b Branch-Name```
Branch name should be: ```PurposeOfTheBranch/NameOfTheBacklogItem-some-description```
Example:
- Working on a new feature FE-003 ```git checkout -b feature/FE-003-nav-bar```
- Fix a bug BF-011: ```git checkout -b bugfix/BF-011-nav-bar-have-too-much-padding```
3. Finish the coding and commit the changes
4. Push to online repo ```git push origin Branch-Name``` use the same branch name here. **Never push to main or any other branches**
5. Go to the github repo
6. Find the Create Pull Request button, add a reviewer and create the request.
7. Wait for the request to be accepted. In the meantime, you can create a new branch and work on something else.
